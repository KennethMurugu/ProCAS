# ProCAS
Welcome to the (Prolog Course Advisor System) ProCAS, an expert system used to advise Form Four Leavers on what course to pursue in institutes of higher learning according to their preferences and grades obtained in KCSE.
All information on courses, course groupings and subject groupings is obtained from KUCCPS.
## How to Use
1. Once procas.pl is consulted in the prolog interpreter, use the query *procas* to initiate the system.
2. You will be prompted to enter various details including preferences (regarding what field you wish to pursue etc) and overall marks obtained in KCSE. Enter the details as prompted (use the query procas_help(field) to view what fields the system supports and procas_help(subjects) to view subject groupings).
3. After all input is given the system will recommend courses to you.

# Help
Use *procas_help(Topic)* to view help messages on various system functions e.g. *procas_help(ver)* to view the System version information, or *procas_help()* to view this help message.

# Plans for the future
- update the course names of the *course/4* facts to show a more user friendly course name
- add more preference choices to further personalize the recommendation(s) given
